# Dry_Beans_DataSet-Analysis-with-96-accuracy
This project is done by me in jupyter notebook  using python language. In this project I have done analysis on dry beans dataset. Discussed the issue with the dataset.  Took out all the issue from dataset. And used 6 different classifers to visualize the accurays and suggested the most accurate model for classifying this dataset.
